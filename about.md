Entering the world of data science with a passion for marketing data, social media, ML and NLP.

### More Information

After 20 years in public education, it was time for a new challenge. 
Teaching STEM classes and earning my Computer Science certification rekindled my interest in coding and data.
I spent a few months in a self-paced learning platform through Data Camp working toward data analytics, but
it wasn't the challenge I was seeking. I attended an event in Miami hosted by Data Science Salon and BrainStation.
I listened to the featured speakers and decided instantly that data science was the path I wanted to follow.
As I complete my Data Science bootcamp, I'm starting my journey by seeking the right opporutnity to continue
my growth in my new career.
